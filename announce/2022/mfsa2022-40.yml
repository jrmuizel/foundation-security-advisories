  CVE-2022-40962:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 105 and Firefox ESR 102.3
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
       Willy R. Vasquez at UT Austin, Mozilla developers Nika Layzell, Timothy Nikkel, Sebastian Hengst, Andreas Pehrson, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 104 and Firefox ESR 102.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
